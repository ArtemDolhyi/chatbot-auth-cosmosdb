# üöÄ Chatbot MVP: Entra ID + Azure Cosmos DB Integration

This repository is part of a **larger chatbot project** that we are actively developing. The code here serves as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** prototype designed to **test authentication capabilities** and **evaluate different options for storing chat history** within the Azure ecosystem.

---

## **üí° Why Azure?**
As we are building our chatbot using **Azure**, we decided to stay within its ecosystem and utilize **Azure-native solutions** for authentication and data storage. This prototype was specifically designed to explore **how well Microsoft Entra ID and Azure Cosmos DB integrate with our chatbot architecture**.

---

## **üåü Why Cosmos DB?**
We chose **Azure Cosmos DB** for its **flexibility, scalability, and performance**. Key advantages include:
- **Globally distributed, low-latency database** with multi-region replication.
- **Schema-agnostic design**, allowing us to store and query structured chat logs efficiently.
- **Automatic indexing** for fast retrieval of conversation history.
- **Seamless integration with other Azure services**, making it a natural fit for our project.

---

## **üîê Why Microsoft Entra ID?**
For authentication, we opted for **Microsoft Entra ID** due to:
- **Secure, enterprise-grade identity management**.
- **Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) experience** for authenticated users.
- **Granular access control and user identity verification**.
- **Support for both guest users and Microsoft-authenticated users**, allowing flexibility in user interaction.

This MVP provides a **basic framework** that will be expanded as the chatbot evolves, ensuring a robust and scalable authentication and data storage solution.
